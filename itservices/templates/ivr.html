        <h2 id="about_heading"><span>What is Hosted IVR ?</span></h2>
        <p>Hosted IVR (Interactive Voice Response) is a process within a telephony menu and routing system, which provides interactive feedback to providers and callers. This means that it is a smooth conversation between the two, which does not require any big team to do. It helps businesses isolate and sort through callers who contact their organization through calls. IVR platforms integrate easily with phone systems. It can also be used with commercial VoIP systems. Due to paucity of time, many such brands are using it today. The main reason for this is that it makes it easy to implement regardless of its internal phone technology. Many IVR applications on the market also offer a different gamut of custom IVR options, allowing each company to use the technology.</p>
        <h2 id="about_heading"><span>How does Hosted IVR work?</span></h2>
        <p>The system often operates based on speech recognition, or, perhaps, a way of understanding and responding to a conversation in general, to allow the caller to interact more naturally with the computerized system. permission can be obtained. Simultaneously, it all works together to reduce inefficiencies within the system and provide customers with the necessary information in a short time, connecting the caller to the right department. Without an IVR, problems such as transferring people to the wrong department or misdirecting calls become more common, which can damage the impression of the business. In this, through the menu system, the business can quickly direct the callers to the relevant person. In this way, customers get their queries answered with less delay, which increases their interaction with the relevant department and organization. In this process the caller calls the number of their respective business. They are given a menu. This menu indicates which department the concerned caller needs to talk to, providing them with pre-selected options where they can find the information they need. These menu options are generally designed based on the most common questions and concerns the business may receive. For example, let’s say that this call is made in a customer company, then they can be directed to options like- Press 1 for our services, press 2 for sales, any kind of complaint Press 3 for this and press 4 to talk to the manager here.
            Once the IVR system receives the request from the caller, they will route the information loaded into their system to the main server and this information will reach the IVR’s main storeroom server, as the computerized system allows the callers to access this information. This helps reduce human error and ensures that all callers can easily access the information they want. Some alternatives may provide auto attendant responses, requiring customers to never interact directly with an employee. However, others will transfer the caller to the correct agent who can answer their question. When it comes to answering callers, businesses have the option of using the text to speech option or pre-recorded messages to communicate with their callers. Text to speech offers some advantages, such as improved ability to respond to a variety of unusual situations. However, there is no cost to manage pre-recorded messages. Each brand will have to evaluate, with their service provider, which option will work best for them. Many IVR systems also use voice recognition to understand the caller’s requests and queries, enabling the customer to interact with the computer in a more human way. In this process. Telecom board and software are interconnected through a computer and telecom system. And all the inputs from customers in it depend on a database. You will need to take the help of a hosting service provider to store the database. Which provides the necessary technical support and helps the business to set up and use the IVR system.</p>
